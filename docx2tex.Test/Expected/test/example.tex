The adaptive fit of a phenotype to its environment follows from the 
degree to which selection and mutation act on that phenotype. We may 
view vital rates (i.e., age-specific survival and reproduction) as 
adaptations, each of which is a complex phenotype determined by numerous 
genetic and environmental factors. Because the strength of selection 
declines with age (HAMILTON 1966), we expect differential adaptation 
leading towards relatively lower rates of early-age mortality and, all 
else being equal, greater rates of reproduction at younger ages. This 
perspective views senescence as a manifestation of an age-related loss 
in adaptation. If mutational effects are themselves dependent upon the 
degree of adaptation, as suggested by \textsc{Fisher} (1958), then the 
effects of mutations will depend upon the age at which they act. 
Mutations will tend to be most deleterious when purifying selection 
against the mutational load is at its greatest. This positive 
association between the influx of deleterious mutational load (greatest 
at early age) and purifying selection (also greatest at early age) will 
tend to dampen the age-related changes in vital rates at 
mutation-selection equilibrium. In other words, negative feedback 
between mutation and selection will cause less senescence than is 
predicted by the standard mutation accumulation model of aging. We 
explore this consequence of Fisher's model on the evolution of 
age-specific mortality using numerical simulations. 

\textbf{Adaptive Geometry}: \textsc{Fisher} (1958) argued that 
because fitness is the result of great physiological and environmental 
complexity, the trajectory of trait adaptation towards an optimum will 
be constrained to a serial process of small improvements. To illustrate 
this point, he introduced a heuristic "\,geometric model of adaptation". 
This model imagines a phenotype represented by a point $P$ that is 
separated from an optimum $O$ in $n$ -dimensional phenospace by some 
Euclidian distance $z$ (Figure 1), where \textit{n} is the number of 
traits that affect the phenotype and are under selection. This 
phenospace represents the entire universe of possible multivariate 
phenotypic configurations. As all points at some distance from the 
optimum are equivalent, the phenotype can be imagined as a circle, 
sphere, or, more generally, a hypersphere with a characteristic radius 
equal to $z$. A change in the phenotype, such as might follow from a 
mutation, will move the genotype away from $P$ by some amount $r$. 
Fisher noted that the probability that such a change moves the phenotype 
closer to the optimum (thereby increasing fitness) decreases with 
increasing $r$ and $n$. Specifically, the probability that a 
mutation is beneficial is approximated by the cumulative standard normal 
distribution,

\ \ \ \ $B(v)\cong \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\int_{v}^{\infty 
}{e^{-\frac{t^{2}}{2}}dt}$\ \ \ \ (1),

where $=\frac{r\sqrt{n}}{z}$ , the effective size of the mutation, and 
$n$, the dimensionality of the trait, is very large (FISHER 1958; 
KIMURA 1983; LEIGH 1987; ORR 1998; RICE 1990). Fisher's model offers a 
useful heuristic means with which to think about the distribution of 
mutational effects. 

\textbf{Age-structure complicates adaptive geometry:} Here, we extend 
Fisher's model to explore how the distribution of mutational effects 
might change with age and with the complexity of vital rates. The fit of 
a phenotype to a particular environment determines the radius of the 
adaptive geometry. Because the selection that drives adaptation is 
attenuated with age, more deleterious age-specific mutations are allowed 
to accumulate at late age (HAMILTON 1966). We expect that the 
age-specific radii of phenotypes \textit{P} will consequently increase 
with age, becoming less well adapted to their age-specific environments. 
We extend Fisher's heuristic model by adding a temporal dimension 
\textit{x}. The result is a series of hyperspheres, each representing 
the $n_{x}$-dimensional adaptive geometry specific to a particular 
age class. Each age-specific hypersphere has some radius, $z_{x}$, 
which follows from the degree of adaptation characteristic of the 
age-specific phenotypes. All else being equal, these radii increase with 
age after the age of reproductive maturity is reached because the 
intensity of selection lessens with age. Because selection for survival 
is not expected to change prior to reproductive maturity, all 
pre-reproductive hyperspheres will have the same radii provided that the 
influx of mutational effects does not change (this assumes that $n_{x}
$ is constant - see below).

Previous applications of Fisher's model illustrate the adaptive geometry 
of a population using the simplest two-dimensional projection of the 
hypersphere, the circle (e.g., HARTL and TAUBES 1996; ORR 1998; ORR 
2006; POON and OTTO 2000; WAXMAN 2006). In keeping with this tradition, 
we imagine a series of circles with radii that increase with age. We 
standardize the age-specific radius for dimensionality by dividing each 
radius $z_{x}$ by the square root of $n_{x}$ (Equation 1). When we 
align the age-ranked circles that represent the radii of reproductive 
ages along the temporal axis that runs perpendicular to the age-specific 
radii, we form a truncated cone (a conical frustum). As the intensity of 
selection on mortality is expected to be constant for all 
pre-reproductive ages (HAMILTON 1966) and provided that complexity is 
constant, the circles for these earliest age-classes will form a column 
with a radius that is equal to the smallest radius of the frustum 
(Figure 2). We define the adaptive geometry of the whole life course by 
appending the pre-reproductive cylinder to the frustum formed by the 
reproductively mature age-classes. Taken together, the age-specific 
shape of the adaptive geometry appears as a funnel in a 
three-dimensional projection. The adaptive geometry of a phenotype at a 
particular age is recovered by taking a cross-section of the funnel 
perpendicular to the temporal axis.

\textbf{Geometric interpretations of age-specific mutational effects:} 
At a single age, a mutational effect on this phenospatial scale can be 
defined by an $n_{x}$-dimensional vector with Euclidean length 
\textit{r}. However, the effect of a mutation over all ages is far 
more complex because a single mutation can have an effect on the 
phenospace at any or all ages. This effect can vary freely in magnitude 
and direction, although the tendency to do so depends upon the degree to 
which an organism's physiology and environment are integrated across 
ages. In light of the model shown in Figure 2, we can visualize a 
mutation with identical phenospatial effects at all ages as a line 
running parallel to the funnel surface. Aside from its effects on this 
multidimensional phenospatial scale, a mutation may also have an effect 
on the univariate fitness scale. This is a change in the spatial 
distance $z$ between the optimum and the new phenotype's adaptive 
position \textit{P}. A mutation is consistently beneficial (or 
deleterious) if it is always within (or always outside) the surface of 
the volume. These types of mutations will contribute to positive fitness 
correlations across ages. Mutational effects that enter and exit the 
volume at different places along \textit{x} will contribute to 
negative fitness correlations across ages - a requirement for 
antagonistically pleiotropic mechanisms for the evolution of senescence. 


In the \textit{window-effect} model (CHARLESWORTH 2001), the effects 
of a mutation are neutral until some age$ x$, have some constant 
effect over $\Delta x$, and then return to neutrality. We can 
visualize the effect of this form of mutational effect by imagining a 
line traveling along the surface of the funnel (Figure 3). At some point 
that corresponds to the earliest age defining the window, the line juts 
outwards (a deleterious mutational effect) or inwards (a beneficial 
mutational effect) in a direction perpendicular to the temporal axis. 
After traveling some distance corresponding to the magnitude of the 
effect (the greater the distance, the greater the effect), the line then 
resumes a course parallel to the surface of the funnel. Upon reaching 
the end of the window (i.e., the age of last effect), the line returns 
to the surface of the funnel and continues to run uninterrupted along 
the surface of the funnel to its terminus. With continuous-time models, 
the window of time becomes infinitesimally small (i.e., $\Delta x\to 0
$) and the number of age classes becomes infinitely large. We can 
attribute the frequent use of the window model in theoretical 
explorations of aging to its apparent simplicity: the duration of the 
effects of mutations is constrained to the size of the window, which can 
define a single age-class. There can be no genetic correlations across 
ages either among mutations or among the genetic variants that segregate 
at mutation-selection equilibrium. As a result, it is straightforward to 
predict evolutionary trajectories. We consider this model in our 
simulations.

\textbf{Numerical simulations of age-specific mortality: }We wished to 
understand how these adaptation-dependent mutational effects influence 
the evolution of senescence as reflected by declines in survival rates 
with age. Because we are particularly interested in the effect of 
mutations on age-specific mortality, we set the within-age class 
variance in reproductive output to zero, thereby assuming that the 
variation in age-specific fitness depends entirely upon three 
factors-the variation in age-specific survival, reproduction as a 
function of age, and the age-structure of the population. This allowed 
us to equate the concept of adaptive geometry to a geometry of 
age-specific survival. We viewed survival at each age (or its negative 
natural logarithm, mortality) as independent phenotypes made up of many 
($n_{x}$) traits under selection. The simultaneous effects of 
window-effect mutations (i.e., a given mutation affects one and only one 
of the non-overlapping windows) and selection upon the mean and variance 
of age-specific survival at mutation-selection equilibrium were explored 
using deterministic simulation models of an age-structured infinite-size 
population coded in R 2.5.1 (R DEVELOPMENT CORE TEAM 2007). Our goal was 
to explore 1) how the mean and variance of mortality (defined as the 
negative logarithm of survival rates) evolve and 2) how the mean and 
variance of mutational effects on mortality change with age when the 
effects of age-specific mutations depend upon the adaptive fit of 
individuals at each age.

We imagined an infinite population that experienced cycles of 
reproduction, mutation, and viability selection for some time $T$ 
sufficient to reach demographic and genetic equilibria. The demographic 
structure of a population with $X$\textit{ }age classes at time $t
$ was described by the probability density function $\pi _{y,t}$, 
where $y$\textit{ }is the age of the cohort. There were $X-1$ 
survival traits; each determined the probability that an individual 
successfully transitioned from age $x$ to age $x+1$. Mutations 
acted on single age classes, corresponding to a window effect model of 
mutation with $\Delta x=1$. Each individual that successfully 
transitioned from age $x$ to age $x+1$ contributed offspring to the 
offspring pool with age-specific fecundity $m_{x}$. The probability 
at time \textit{t} that an individual belonging to $y$\textit{ }
has an age \textit{x-}specific phenotype (the distance to the 
age-specific optimum) equal to $z$ is $p_{z,x,y,t}$. Cohorts 
expressed these phenotypes when $y=x$. Otherwise the phenotypes were 
latent, having been expressed before (if $y>x$) or waiting to be 
expressed in the future ($y<x$ ). We defined survival as an 
exponential function of phenospatial distances, $P_{z}=e^{-z}$, 
because survivorship mutations are usually considered to act additively 
on the log scale (CHARLESWORTH 1994; HAMILTON 1966 - but see BAUDISCH 
2005). Thus, the distance of a phenotype from the optimum defined its 
age-specific mortality exactly, $z=\mu _{x}=-\ln (P_{z})$. 

We explored the case of four age classes ($X=4$) with three 
transition traits determining the survival probabilities. The distance $
z$ (mortality) ranged from 0.0025 to 10.0025 and was binned into 
classes of size 0.005. Thus, there were 2000 possible phenotypes 
available to each individual at each age $x$. At any time $t$ there 
were nine phenotypic distributions (three cohorts each with three 
age-specific phenotypes), we represented each of these with a vertical 
vector $p_{x,y,t}$. This is the distribution of distance $z$ for 
age $x$ among cohort $y$ at time $t$. Initially, the population's 
age distribution and age-specific breeding value distributions were 
uniform: $\pi _{x,1}=\frac{1}{X} $and $p_{z,x,y,1}=\frac{1}{2000}$ 
for all $x,y,$\textit{ }and\textit{ }$z$. Differently put, 
age-specific survival within ages was highly variable but there was no 
mean change in survival with age (i.e., no initial senescence). 

A long held conclusion of life history theory is that age-related 
increases in fecundity will mitigate (but not completely eliminate) the 
evolution of senescence by increasing the relative intensity of 
selection on late-age survival (WILLIAMS 1957). To explore the effect of 
varying late-age selection on survival, we considered three different 
reproductive functions, $m_{1}=\lbrace 0,1,1\rbrace $, $m_{2}=\lbrace 
0,1,2\rbrace , $and $m_{3}=\lbrace 0,1,4\rbrace $ with the expectation 
that age-specific selection will decline with age most with $m_{1}$ 
and least with $m_{3}$. In each treatment, reproduction was delayed 
until after the second transition. This provided one test of our 
simulation model: because the decline in selection associated with age 
was deferred until the onset of reproduction, we expected no change in 
equilibrium mortality associated with the first two transitions when the 
mortality effects of mutations were held constant. Any differences in 
mortality rates at mutation-selection equilibrium between the first two 
transitions could not be due to differences in selection. We designate 
the three age-specific survival traits as: juvenile survival 
(transitioning from $x=1 to 2$), early adult survival (from $x=2 to 
3$), and late adult survival (from $x=3 to 4$). 

\textbf{Viability selection: }Every cohort had $X-1$ phenotypic 
distributions, each corresponding to mortality at a different age. At 
each time step, selection changed the phenotypic distributions in each 
cohort that corresponded to mortality at that time, $x=y$. Following 
our definition of bins and the survival function, age-specific survival 
could range from a high of 99.75\% to a low of less than 0.00005\%. We 
defined a vertical vector $s$ in which each element corresponds to the 
survival of a phenotype, $s=e^{-z}$, where $z=\lbrace 
\frac{1}{400},\frac{3}{400} ,\cdots , \frac{4001}{400}\rbrace $. The 
distributions of phenotypes currently under selection are described by $
p_{y,y,t}$. After selection, these distributions were re-weighted by 
their phenotype-specific viability, 

\ \ \ \ $p_{y,y+1,t+1}=\frac{s\cdot p_{y,y,t}}{s^{T}\cdot p_{y,y,t}}$
\ \ \ \ (2).

Other distributions $x\ne y$ were shielded from selection. Thus \ \ \ 
\ 

\ \ \ \ $p_{x,y+1,t+1}=p_{x,y,t}$\ \ \ \ (3).

We standardized the age-distributions to correct for mortality and the 
production of new offspring. First, we found the un-standardized size of 
each cohort at time $t+1$ that followed from viability selection, 

\ \ \ \ $\pi _{y+1,t+1}^{'}=\pi _{y,t}\times s^{T}\cdot p_{y,y,t}$\ \ 
\ \ (4).

The size of each new cohort $y=1$ follows from the previous 
age-structure $\pi _{y,t}$ and the age-specific fecundity function $m
$, $\pi _{1,t+1}^{'}=\sum_{y=1}^{Y}{\pi _{y,t}\cdot m_{y}}$. We 
standardize the new age-structure to account for this new cohort,

\ \ \ \ $\pi _{y,t+1}=\frac{\pi _{y,t+1}^{'}}{\sum_{y=1}^{Y}{\pi 
_{y,t+1}}}$\ \ \ \ (5).

\textbf{Reproduction and mutation: }All surviving individuals 
reproduced asexually at the end of each time period \textit{t.} 
Phenotypes were assumed to be completely heritable, excepting the 
effects of mutation (like POON and OTTO (2000),we ignore environmental 
variation). To model the distribution of mutation effects, we followed 
closely the mutation model of \textsc{Poon} and \textsc{Otto} 
(2000). The effect of mutation on all phenotypic traits was assumed to 
be distributed as a set of $n$ independent reflected exponentials 
(symmetric about zero) each with the same parameter $\lambda $. Under 
this assumption, the magnitude $r$ was distributed as 

\ \ \ \ $p(r,n)=\frac{\lambda ^{n}e^{-\lambda r}r^{n-1}}{\Gamma (n)}$
\ \ \ \ (6),

and the angle $\theta $ as

\ \ \ \ $p(\theta ,n)=c^{'}\sin ^{n-2}\theta $,\ \ \ \ (7),

where

\ \ \ \ $c^{'}=\frac{\Gamma (\frac{n}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi }\Gamma \lbrack 
\frac{1}{2}(n-1)\rbrack }$\ \ \ \ (7a).

For some initial distance \textit{z}, mutational distance \textit{r
}, and effective orientation \textit{?}, the distance of the changed 
phenotype from the optimum was

\ \ \ \ $z^{'}=\sqrt{z^{2}+r^{2}-2zr cos\theta }$\ \ \ \ (8).

We re-arranged Equation 8 to find the angle of mutational effect that 
caused the distance to transition from distance $z$ to $z^{'}$,

\ \ \ \ $\theta (z,r,z^{'})=\cos 
^{-1}(\frac{z^{2}+r^{2}-z^{'}^{2}}{2zr})$\ \ \ \ (9).

We used Equations 6-9 to find the probability that a mutation at 
distance $z$ would end up within some distance $\pm \frac{1}{400}$ 
from every possible value of $z$.\textbf{ }The probability that a 
mutation shifts the phenotype from $z$ to the interval $z^{'}\pm 
\frac{1}{400}$ was

\ \ \ \ $Pr\lbrace z+\Delta z-\frac{1}{400}<z^{'}<z+\Delta 
z+\frac{1}{400}\rbrace =\int_{r=\Delta z}^{Z+z}{\int_{\theta 
(z,r,z+\Delta z-\frac{1}{400})}^{\theta (z,r,z+\Delta 
z+\frac{1}{400})}{p(r,n)p(\theta ,n)d\theta dr}}$\ \ \ \ (10). 

Mutations with effect $r>Z+z$ caused the new phenotype to equal 
\textit{Z}, making \textit{Z} an absorbing boundary. By applying 
Equation 10 to all elements of $z$, we defined the probability 
transition matrix for a single mutation $U(n_{x},\lambda )$. The 
number of mutations $n^{}$ introduced in each offspring was 
Poisson-distributed with parameter $u=1$, a value that conforms to 
estimates of mutation rates in \textit{Drosophila} (HAAG-LIAUTARD
\textit{ et al.} 2007). Taking account of the variation in the number 
of mutations per time unit, the mutational probability transition matrix 
was

\ \ \ \ $U^{}(n_{x},\lambda )=\sum_{n^{}=0}^{\infty }{Pr(n^{})\times 
\lbrack U(n_{x},\lambda )\rbrack ^{n^{}}}$\ \ \ \ (11). 

Each cohort contributed to each age-specific \textit{pdf} of 
phenotypes in proportion to the product of its current fecundity and 
fractional representation of the population. Given the vertical vector 
of phenotypic probabilities at time \textit{t}, $p_{x,y,t}$, the 
\textit{pdf }of mortality phenotypes of the offspring cohort after 
mutation specific to some age of expression \textit{x} was

\ \ \ \ $p_{x,1,t+1}=U^{}(n_{x},\lambda ,u)\cdot \frac{\sum_{y}^{Y}{\pi 
_{y,t}\cdot m_{y}\cdot p_{x,y,t}}}{\pi _{1,t+1}^{'}}$\ \ \ \ (12).

The phenotypic effects of mutations are expected to be greatest with 
high \textit{n} and low $\lambda $ (POON and OTTO 2000). To explore 
the consequences of changing these mutational parameters on 
mutation-selection equilibrium and mutation accumulation, we considered 
each of $\lambda ?\lbrace 50,100,150,200\rbrace $. Complexity is a 
central component of Fisher's geometric model and some studies have 
suggested that the complexity of phenotypic traits may change as an 
organism ages (KAPLAN\textit{ et al.} 1991; LIPSITZ and GOLDBERGER 
1992 but see GOLDBERGER\textit{ et al.} 2002; VAILLANCOURT and NEWELL 
2002). We investigated how complexity affected age-related changes in 
mutational effects by considering a variety of age-specific functions of 
$n$. First we considered the scenario in which $n$ is constant 
across all ages (age-independent complexity), with$ n?\lbrace 
10,15,20,25\rbrace $. In addition, we explored what happens when 
complexity changes with age (age-dependent complexity). Specifically, we 
considered what happens if 1) complexity increases between adult 
age-classes, $n_{x}=\lbrace 10,10,20\rbrace $, 2) complexity decreases 
between adult age-classes, $n_{x}=\lbrace 20,20,10\rbrace $, 3) 
complexity increases between juvenile and adult age-classes, $
n_{x}=\lbrace 10,20,20\rbrace $, and 4) complexity decreases between 
juvenile and adult age-classes, $n_{x}=\lbrace 20,10,10\rbrace $. 
Scenarios 1-2 were investigated to see if changes in complexity caused 
qualitative shifts in the degree to which senescence evolves in 
reproductive age classes. Scenarios 3-4 were investigated to see how 
changes in complexity caused equilibrium mortality to diverge between 
the juvenile and the early adult age classes (recall that selection for 
both juvenile and early adult survival are equal because juveniles 
cannot reproduce). 

\textbf{Mutation-selection balance and mutation accumulation}:
\textbf{ }All simulations were allowed to evolve for $T$ generations, 
defined as the point at which none of the phenotypic distributions 
deviated from those at generation $T-1$ to the resolution limit of R 
2.5.1. These distributions defined the mutation-selection equilibrium 
specific to the population with parameters $m_{x},n_{x},\lambda $ and $
u$. We then removed selection from the populations by changing the 
survival function to $P_{z}=1$ and allowing the populations to evolve 
for an additional 50 time units. We attributed the changes in the mean 
and variance of age-specific mortality between generations $T+50$ and 
$T$ to the effects of \textit{de novo }mutation accumulation.
